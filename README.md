# Conversation Assignment

For my conversation assignment I thought it would be useful to have a bot that could provide me with links to the Watson Conversation documentation for specific topics.

The current implementation is bare bones, but I may improve it given enough free time (I have none).


## Example Behavior

```text
Conversation> Hello, how may I assist you?
You> How can I create entities?
Conversation> Let me look for entries related to: entity.
Conversation> I found the following results related to entity:
https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/entities.html
```
